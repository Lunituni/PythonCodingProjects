# PythonCodingProjects
Greetings visitor! 

In PythonCodingProjects you can view and use the files for whatever reason as long as you respect the MiT-license.
Most of the stuff is related to school/university-projects I have been working on, but as already said, if you need to use 
anything, its free of charge :)

Best regards,

Dragoljub Blagojevic
